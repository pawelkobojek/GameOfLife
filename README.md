This code is prepared in order to perform simple experiments on how initial life distribution probability in Game of Life affects number of epochs before the population fully extincts.

## Running

We have provided bash script for compiling and running the experiments.<br/>
To do so run: 
```
chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
